INSTALLING PYTHON 3.8

To run the top_poses.py script, you must include a link to a working python3.8 executable.
On Wynton Python 3.8 is installed @ /wynton/group/bks/soft/python-versions/python-3.8-install

How to install from source:

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.8/Python-3.8.8.tgz
tar -xzf Python-3.8.8.tgz
cd Python-3.8.8
./configure --prefix=<full path to wherever you want python to be installed>

If you are installing to wynton, you must log into a dev node before all this, otherwise the necessary libraries won't be available.

Now in the top_poses directory:

ln -s <python install directory>/bin/python3.8 python3.8

And you are good to go!
